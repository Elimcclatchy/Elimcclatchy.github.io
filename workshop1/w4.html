      "In my experience, the word “code” means a set of directions to look and adhere to in a given situation. My experience with coding in the technological sense is essentially nonexistent. I imagine coding to be the language of computer programs. A set of binary digits, at the most basic level, that the computer is able to read and therefore arrange the pixels of its monitor to produce an image. This image is not always a physical representation on a screen. It could be some electronic signal deep in the wires of a computer. When adhering to a set of instructions, as a computer does when there is an input and as a human does when given a set of instructions.
